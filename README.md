# CurrencyLineBot

This a the webhook server for my "Currency Reminder" Line Bot which serves as your personal financial assistant. 
It is capable of showing the lastest conversion rate (priority: spot selling rate first, than bank note selling rate) 
of the foreign currency to New Taiwan Dollar from Bank of Taiwan. 

The rate alert feature is under development and will be available in the future.
